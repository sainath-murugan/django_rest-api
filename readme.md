# Django API project
An `API` is one of the set of programming code such as `json` or `xml` enables data transmission from one software products to another. APIs are mainly used in web development to boost and  powerup the website with data.

# About the project
    
I have developed a blog `API` with the help of `django rest framework` one of the powerfull library of python.

This `djano rest framework` converts `django` database object to `json` data by `serializers`.And the endpoint can be used by `third-party` website.

This blog api is secured by third-party packages such as
* `dj-rest-auth`
* `djang-allauth`

# contribute

However, i have not used any frontend framework such as react :rocket: . so if anybody like to contribute they are always welcome :wink:
